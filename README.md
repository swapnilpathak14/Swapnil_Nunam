# Nunam_Assignment
The following repository contains tasks from the assignment given for the assessment for Data Engineering Internship at Nunam.
It consists of 3 tasks.

* Task 1: Collect and extract the data from two excel sheets and then create 3 separate .csv files named, 'detail.csv', 'detailVol.csv', and 'detailTemp.csv'.

* Task 2: To apply a down-sampling method and reduce the sampling rate to 1 sample per minute in all the 3 .csv files obtained from the previous task.
